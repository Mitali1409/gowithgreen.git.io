<center><p style="font-size:100;"> In 2018, I suddenly found myself with a strong desire to acquire more plants.<br> Armed with a list of recommendations from a plant-savvy <br>colleague, </p><p>I went to Home Depot and dipped my toes<br> into the world of greenery. <br>Many months later, my home is now home to nearly 30 <br>plants of different types and sizes.<br> Coming home is like stepping into my own personal zen<br> space,<br> a haven from the co1d, concrete world outside. <br> 
                  <p> we believe plants and nature are the antidote to the stress we feel<br> from being so connected to screens.<br> so we started this "GO GREEN" plant selling shop. <br>This Pandamic gives us <br>idea to sell plant through internet. we start this program ,and yes its working !
